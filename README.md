Module 4 Challenge

For the PyCitySchool_Analysis, I used the starter code provided and the two csv files. I went over the lecture notes. I attended office hours and Joseph the TA helped me correct some errors in my code. One of my class mates also helped calculate the per capital budget because I accidentally deleted that code line and couldn't figure it out anymore. The error was in my per school budget. Google also helped.

Analysis

In this pandas challanged we used two csv files and then merged them together into one dataset that included school information, student information and scores for both reading and math. Then we summarized district information and displayed the information in a Data Frame called district_summary. It gave us the total number of schools and students in the district, the total budget and average scores as well as percentages. Then we further broke down the information by schools and displayed our findings in another data frame called per_school_summary. This dataframe displayed information for each of the 15 schools in the district. The information included the school type, number of students, budget for the school , budget per student, scores and percentages and overall passing. After we were asked to organize the schools by Overall Passing % from descending order. After, we sorted bottom performing schools by Overall Passing %. Then, we analyzed both reading and math scores by grades (9-12) and displayed the information according to each school. We followed the money, and investigated if school spending has any effects on scores. In trying to determine what affects scores, we organized the school data by size and finally, by school type.

From the data we can conclude that schools in the district and therefore the district as a whole performs better in reading than in math. From the district summary we can see that it has an 85.81% passing rate in reading vs a 74.98 in math. The overall passing is not great by 65.17% (at least 70% would be better in my opinion).

Also, I could not help but notice the discrepancy in performance between charter schools and district schools. All of the top 5 performers are from charter schools with the number one school(Cabrera) achieving an overall passing of 91.33%. In comparison, the bottom performing school, Rodriguez H.S., is a disctrict school with only 52.99% overall passing (hardly more than half of its student population). Money does not seem to affect performance since the bottom-performing schools have student budget the same (if not slightly bigger) than the top-performing schools.
